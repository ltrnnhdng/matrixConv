# matrixConv
This is a last-term project from a subject called **"Hardware design for deep-learning"**, where we learn about Vivado HLS and how to optimize our solution in a design. 

This semester's project is about designing a **Matric Convolution Accelerator** using HLS's directives and constraints.

In this project, we set the input matrix to be 15x15 and the kernel matrix to be 5x5.

Below is the C/RTL simulation result of our design:
